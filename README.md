## Technical Details

The extension consists of the following components:

- **manifest.json**: Extension configuration and permissions
- **popup.html/css/js**: User interface for the extension popup
- **content.js**: Script that runs on webpages to handle element selection
- **background.js**: Handles background tasks and data persistence between tabs

Selected element data includes:
- Tag name
- Element ID
- Class names
- Text content
- XPath location
- CSS selector
- Complete HTML content (in a dedicated "selectedElement" column)
- Selection timestamp

## State Synchronization

The extension maintains synchronized state between:
- The floating navbar on the webpage
- The extension popup interface
- Chrome's local storage

This ensures a consistent experience regardless of how you interact with the extension.

## Privacy and Data Security

This extension operates entirely on your local machine. No data is sent to any remote servers, and all collected information remains in your browser until explicitly exported as a CSV file. The extension requires only the necessary permissions to function.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't appear to be working:

1. Make sure it's properly installed and enabled in Chrome extensions
2. Try refreshing the webpage before activating selection mode
3. Check if another extension might be interfering with element selection
4. If the navbar disappears unexpectedly, click the extension icon and start selection mode again
